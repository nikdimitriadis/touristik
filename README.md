This is the first page that I had made. After a few weeks of learning the basics of web development, I tried to implement this knowledge.
My main focus was to learn how to use the flex-box, grid and position under different circumstances. Additionally, I tried to write clean and understandable code. 
I added some basic animations from the AOS library on this landing page. While working on the project, I had learned a lot of things such as better understanding of how and when flex-box, grid and different positions should be used
and how these attributtes impact on the flow of the page.
